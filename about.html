    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Mohamed Farah, an aspiring web developer currently diving into the world of HTML5. With a passion for technology and a keen interest in creating engaging web experiences, I am excited to build my skills in web development. <br><br>
            I began my journey into coding with a focus on HTML5, the cornerstone of modern web design. I am fascinated by how HTML5 enhances the web experience through its rich features, such as multimedia support, improved semantics, and responsive design capabilities. My goal is to master these elements to create visually appealing and accessible websites.
